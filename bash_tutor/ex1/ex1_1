# This script should get input from user
# 	and write to a file as follows
#
# Name: 
# Address:
# Phone: 
#
# 	and display a msg like
#		Details stored in "details.out"
#
# Hint: usage of \ before "
#
# Solution:
# 
# 1. get input from user using "read"
# 	and hence storing each details 
#		in a variable like "name"
# 2. Write the variables to a file
# 	using ">"(overwrite), ">>"(append) operators
# 3. Use $var_name for getting the value of variables
#



echo 
echo -n "Enter your Name: "
# use of "-n" option to avoid new line

read name
# getting input from user 
# 	storing it in var "name"

echo 
echo -n "Enter Address: "

read address

echo
echo -n "Enter Phone no: "

read phone

echo
echo "Name: $name" > details.out
# getting value of var "name" by
#	using $ symbol and writing
#		it to a file

echo "Address: $address" >> details.out

echo "Phone: $phone" >> details.out

echo Details stored in \"details.out\" 
# usage of \ befor " for using 
#  " as normal charecter and 
#     not using it special powers
