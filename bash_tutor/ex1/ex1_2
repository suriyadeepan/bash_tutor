# This program is supposed to store the some info in a file
#	and the file is supposed to look like below:
	
	
# no of users :
# no of users logged on:
# no of processes:

# Hint: ps, who, wc -l 

# Solution:
# 1. "who" gives who is logged on
# 2. piping the o/p of "who" to i/p of wc (as wc --lines)
#	we can find no. of users logged on
# 3. "ps" lists all the running processes
#	"ps | wc --lines" gives no. of running processes
# 4. "cat /etc/passwd" lists all possible users
# 	it can again be piped to i/p of "wc"

# lets get started!


echo -n "No of users : " > usr_info.out
who | wc --lines >> usr_info.out
echo >> usr_info.out
echo -n "No of users logged on: " >> usr_info.out
cat /etc/passwd | wc --lines >> usr_info.out
echo >> usr_info.out
echo -n "No of processes running: " >> usr_info.out
ps | wc --lines >> usr_info.out


echo 
echo User details stored in \"usr_info.out\"
